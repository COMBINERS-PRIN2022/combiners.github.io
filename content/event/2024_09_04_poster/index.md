## Title
Detecting spatial health disparities using disease maps

## Abstract
Epidemiologists commonly use regional aggregates of health outcomes to map mortality or incidence rates and identify geographic disparities. However, to detect health disparities across regions, it is necessary to identify “difference boundaries” that separate neighboring regions with significantly different spatial effects. This can be particularly challenging when dealing with multiple outcomes for each region and accounting for dependence among diseases and across regions. We address detection of multivariate difference boundaries for correlated diseases by formulating the problem in terms of Bayesian pairwise multiple comparisons by extending it through the introduction of adjacency modeling and disease graph dependencies. Specifically, we seek the posterior probabilities of neighboring spatial effects being different. To accomplish this, we adopt a class of multivariate areally referenced Dirichlet process models that accommodate spatial and inter-disease dependence by endowing the spatial random effects with a discrete probability law. Our method is evaluated through simulation studies and applied to detect difference boundaries for multiple cancers using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program of the National Cancer Institute.

## Title
Two-stage differential network analysis

## Abstract
In this work, we propose a novel two-stage methodology for differential network analysis in two-sample problems. The focus is on estimating and localizing differences in the networks of two conditions. The first stage involves node-level screening to test the equality of node-conditional distributions under two conditions. Each node-conditional distribution is modeled using generalized linear models, and the equality of distributions is tested via likelihood ratio tests. In this stage, the overall false discovery rate is controlled across all nodes. The second stage delves deeper into the nodes where the initial hypothesis of equality was rejected, testing each individual parameter within these node-conditional distributions to identify and localize specific differences. This method is suitable for situations without prior knowledge about the network structure in the two conditions and can also include a preliminary step to estimate the networks to increase the power of the procedure. It can also incorporate prior information about the network structure if available.
