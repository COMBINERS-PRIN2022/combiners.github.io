All my research has been devoted to Graphical Markov Models. The class of Graphical Markov Models is so vast that includes many existing models, like Structural Equation Models, log-linear models, and so on, that I never get tired in exploring them from the theoretical point of view and in using them in applied data analysis.
From the theoretical point of view I have been attracted by issues of identification and distortion induced by unobserved factors. For that I have also received a grant from the American Institute of Mathematics AIM ('SQuaRE' grant 2011-2013). In many applied research I have been using Graphical Models with latent variables.
Currently, I am a member of SIMSAM, Interdisciplinary research group on early life exposure and health - A registry-based life-course perspective with modern epidemiological and statistical approches. Further Research Interests include Credit Scoring.
