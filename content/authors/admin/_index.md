This project concerns the development of novel principled statistical tools for the analysis of complex networks under non-standard experimental setups. 

The methodological innovations are achieved with this proposal are as follows:  
- Development of multiple, paired, and covariate-dependent graphical models for heterogeneous networks;
- Development of single and multiple graphical models for causal inference based on observational and interventional data; 
- Development of graphical models for non-normal and censored random variables. 

This projects is developed by the collaborative efforts of four research units based at the University of Florence ([UNIFI](https://www.unifi.it/changelang-eng.html)), Universit√† Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, ([UCSC](https://www.unicatt.eu)), University of Padua ([UNIPD](https://www.unipd.it/en/)), and University of Palermo ([UNIPA](https://www.unipa.it/mobilita/en/)).
