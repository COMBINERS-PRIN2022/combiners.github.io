He graduated in Electronics Engineering from the University of Rome “La Sapienza” and received a doctoral degree in Mathematical Statistics from the University of Pavia (Department of Mathematics). His research activity has developed in different areas of statistics, with a special interest for Bayesian methods and graphical models. He was visiting researcher at several foreign universities (University of Aalborg, DK, University of Warwick, UK, University of Pau and Pays de l'Adour, FR, University of Florida, US, University of Southampton, UK, University of Granada, ES). Besides authoring a number of scientific papers, he has published three software libraries (BayHaz, giRaph, FBFsearch) in the main R Project archive (CRAN).
