I am an Assistant Professor non-tenure track (Universit√§tsassistentin) in the Research Unit of Applied Statistics (ASTAT) at the Vienna University of Technology (TU Wien). I am also an affiliated member at Harvard University in the Harvard-MIT Center for Regulatory Science. Before joining TU Wien, I was a research fellow (assegnista di ricerca) at the University of Florence in the Department of Statistics, Computer Science, Applications ''G. Parenti'', working with Prof. Francesco Stingo and Prof. Monia Lupparelli. Prior to the University of Florence, I was a postdoctoral fellow in Statistics at Harvard University in the Harvard-MIT Center for Regulatory Science, and I was also part of Prof. Lorenzo Trippa's group at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (DFCI) in the Department of Data Science.I did my PhD in Statistics on the joint CDT programme between the University of Warwick and the University of Oxford (OxWASP). I worked on statistical methods for genomic data analysis with Prof. David Rossell (UPF) and Prof. Richard Savage (Warwick).
